This project uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve video information. To use this API in your own project, you will need to create your own API key.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create a new YouTube Data API key. You can find instructions on how to do this in the [YouTube Data API documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application). Once you have your API key, you can add it to your project in one of two ways:

1. Add the API key to your code directly.
2. Use the dotenv package to store your API key in a .env file.

Make sure to keep your API key secure and not share it publicly in a code repository or any other publicly accessible location. Additionally, please be aware of any usage limitations or terms of service associated with using the YouTube Data API key.
